## Documentation

## Recording Manager

This class is meant to be used anywhere you want to be able to record audio. You will need to have one of the [encoder packages](#encoder-packages) to be able to record and encode to the specific format.

A perfect example implementation on how to use this is in the `AbstractRecordingBehaviour` class.

## Recording Behaviour

A basic `AbstractRecordingBehaviour` is included in this package to make it very simple to add recording to any GameObject in the scene. This class is really meant to be a good baseline example of how to use the `RecordingManager`. This abstract class is implemented in each of the encoder packages for simplicity and ease of use.

## Audio Clip Extensions

Provides extensions to encode `AudioClip`s to PCM encoded bytes.
Supports 8 bit and 16 bit sample sizes.
