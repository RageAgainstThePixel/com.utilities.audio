A simple package for audio extensions and utilities in the [Unity](https://unity.com/) Game Engine.

## Installing

Requires Unity 2021.3 LTS or higher.

The recommended installation method is though the unity package manager and [OpenUPM](https://openupm.com/packages/com.utilities.audio).

### Via Unity Package Manager and OpenUPM

- Open your Unity project settings
- Select the `Package Manager`

- Add the OpenUPM package registry:
  - Name: `OpenUPM`
  - URL: `https://package.openupm.com`
  - Scope(s):
    - `com.utilities`
- Open the Unity Package Manager window
- Change the Registry from Unity to `My Registries`
- Add the `Utilities.Audio` package

## Documentation

On its own this package doesn't do too much but provide base functionality for recording audio in the Unity Editor and during runtime. Instead, use the [encoder packages](#encoder-packages) to fully utilize this package and its contents.

## Recording Manager

This class is meant to be used anywhere you want to be able to record audio. You will need to have one of the [encoder packages](#encoder-packages) to be able to record and encode to the specific format.

A perfect example implementation on how to use this is in the `AbstractRecordingBehaviour` class.

## Recording Behaviour

A basic `AbstractRecordingBehaviour` is included in this package to make it very simple to add recording to any GameObject in the scene. This class is really meant to be a good baseline example of how to use the `RecordingManager`. This abstract class is implemented in each of the [encoder packages](#encoder-packages) for simplicity and ease of use.

## Audio Clip Extensions

Provides extensions to encode `AudioClip`s to PCM encoded bytes.
Supports 8, 16, 24, and 32 bit sample sizes.

### Encode PCM

```csharp
// Encodes the <see cref="AudioClip"/> to raw PCM bytes.
var pcmBytes = audioClip.EncodeToPCM();
```

### Decode PCM

```csharp
// Decodes the raw PCM byte data and sets it to the audioClip.
audioClip.DecodeFromPCM(pcmBytes);
```
